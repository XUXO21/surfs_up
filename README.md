## Overview of the analysis
--
The objetvive is obtain the sponsorship of an investor in order to be able to open our dream job asurf and ice cream shop on our dream land Oahu, but our main potential investor is worried about the weather and for that reason we have been asked to perform a analysis to make sure this is a considered factor and will no be a menace that could put in jeopardy the potential busniess.

We will be working with a data set of Oahu island that includes information such as temperature and precipitation among other information. The tool we are using to build this analysis will be SQL Lite and other tools we hace used in the past.

On the challenge stage we will analyze June and December temperatures. This two months make a great sample to understand differences between one of the highest peak of temperature (June) and one of the lowest (December).

## Results:
--

*June average temperature is 74.9 F degrees 
*Std Dev is only 3 degrees so we can see there is not to high variation throughout the month.
*Minimum temperature can be somehow low but is not cold, is still suitable to take an icecream or go to the beach
*while Maximum temperature is hot enough to have good sales growth

*June average temperature is 71.0 F degrees 
*Std Dev is only 3,7 degrees so we can see higher variation throughout the month.
*Minimum temperature can be cold enough to diminish traffic on the beach but is hot enough to still have clients at least for surfing.
*Maximum temperature is very similiar to June one it is hot enough to have good sales growth

### Summary:

* June is denietly a month were sales could thrive for both the surf shop and the ice cream shop
* When we compare December vs June we can see that even Decemeber has the potential of generate good sales, temepratures are lower than june, es expected, but average temp. has only 3 F degrees diference, and we can see almost the same difference on the max. temp.

But how often are this temperatures presented across the month?

That's the reason this plots come handy:

1. June Temperature

2. December Temperature

![Decplot](/Images/Dec_plot.png)

*As we can see temperatures of 70, 75 and 80F degrees are the most common along June
*On December we can see that the more common temps move around 68 up to 72 and even 75F degrees

In conclusion even December "low" temperatures are good enough to sell nor only surf items but even ice cream, and for that reason business is fisable.
